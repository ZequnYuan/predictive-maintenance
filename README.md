# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

This repository contains the final project for CS505 - Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

## üìå Project Summary

Unexpected machine failures can lead to high maintenance costs and production downtime. This project predicts equipment failure using the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine dataset. Multiple models were explored, including:

- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks

The LSTM model achieved the highest performance, with 91.8% accuracy and a 13.4 RMSE for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction.

## üìÅ Files

- `predictive_maintenance.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- `README.md`: This file
- `train_sample.csv`: A small sample of the C-MAPSS dataset (if allowed)
- `report.docx`: Final project report (upload manually)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ZequnYuan/predictive-maintenance
